In collaboration with the [Illinois St. Andrew
Society](http://www.chicagoscots.org/), Tim or accordionist Richard MacDonald
are leading a Scottish jam session on certain Tuesdays.

All sessions will take place at the [Duke of Perth](http://dukeofperth.com/) in Lakeview East (2913 N Clark St), begin
at 7PM, and run until 9 or so. Some of us arrive around 6 for dinner, feel free to join in!

Everyone is encouraged to play their favorite Scottish tunes, but newcomers to the
Scottish style might find it useful to look over the collection of [tunes we'll probably
play](/assets/docs/jam-tunes.pdf).  We try to be aggressively welcoming to new players of all abilities: the jam is
usually a mix of professional musicians (either in folk or classical music), amateurs, and even beginners who just play
open strings in the right key. We'll always figure out how to get you involved if you show up with an instrument!
