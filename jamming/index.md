In collaboration with the [Illinois St. Andrew Society](http://www.chicagoscots.org/), Tim is leading a Scottish jam
session on certain Tuesdays.

All sessions will take place at the [Duke of Perth](http://dukeofperth.com/) in Lakeview East (2913 N Clark St), begin
at 7PM, and run until 9 or so.  Everyone is encouraged to play their favorite Scottish tunes, but newcomers to the
Scottish style might find it useful to look over the collection of [tunes we'll probably play](/assets/docs/jam-tunes.pdf).
